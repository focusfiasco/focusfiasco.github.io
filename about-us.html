      <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are data scientists, writers, ball players, but most importantly, fans of the game. Graphletics is the community we’re building to share how we’re answering all of our basketball-related (and sometimes unrelated) questions…like <em>“How much does travel and weather really affect a player and team’s performance?”</em> or <em>“Which player has spent the highest percentage of their income on technical fouls?”</em><br><br>The best part about the NBA, and basketball as a whole, is that it remains approachable and light-hearted, but intensely serious and competitive at the same time. We’re taking that same attitude with Graphletics. Advanced statistics can often times be hokey, detached from the game, and feel like a mysterious black-box. We’ll try our best to always keep the game fun, show relevant and interesting stats and analyses, and provide how we arrived at our answers.<br><strong>Core values:</strong></p>
      <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Love for the game</p></li>
        <li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Curiosity</p></li>
        <li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scientific Method</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most important though…is to go out and watch basketball games (not just the highlights on YouTube and IG). Not all the statistical analyses in the world can replace all the data you collect with your eyes and ears, and process in your mind. Graphletics is meant to supplement the way you view the game, not replace it. So...watch basketball, ask questions, join the discussion, and see the numbers behind the game.<br><br>If you have data that you’re interested in analyzing, or questions that you want answers to, send us an email!<br>Contact: patrick@graphletics.com</p>
